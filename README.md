# ALTAIR-SOUNDING-ROCKET
 This report details the technical specifications of thrustMIT’s latest rocket Altair, for the
 2023 Spaceport America Cup in the 10k COTS category. Project Altair is designed to reach
 an apogee of 10,000 feet carrying a non-deployable payload and recover back completely
 using a reefed parachute. It is powered by a Cesaroni Pro98 M3400-P solid propellant COTS
 motor. The rocket features a carbon fibre as well as glass fibre composite fuselages along
 with Aluminium 6061 bulkheads, centering rings, stringers, fins and thrust plate for added
 structural strength. The avionics is a combination of SRAD and COTS systems for additional
 redundancy. The payload team set out to demonstrate attitude control by building a 3 DoF
 parallel manipulator system which will balance itself using a PID based controller under high
 vibrations and G-Forces. The payload consists of the parallel manipulator which is actuated
 by three servo motors. Successful implementation of such a control system in the payload will
 immensely help the team in its future applications of attitude control systems in the rocket
 such as fin control, thrust vector control etc. A new custom airbrakes mechanism is a unique
 characteristic of our launch vehicle. This is team’s first attempt at implementing active controls
 into the rocket.
